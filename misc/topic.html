<h1>Technology Addiction and Workaholism Ideas</h1>

<h4>What is technology addiction?</h4>
<p>Technology or internet addiction involves a consistent overuse of technology such as mobile phones, tablets, and computers. It can also be distinguished by a person continuing to spend large amounts of time using technology while ignoring its negative consequences such as difficulties at school or work, fatigue, and social isolation (TechTarget Contributor 2018). Another aspect of technology addiction is that when attempts are made to reduce the amount of time spent on a device, withdrawal symptoms such as moodiness, restlessness and irritability may occur, among others (TechTarget Contributor 2018).</p>

<h4>What is workaholism?</h4>
<p>Workaholism involves a person who may feel the need to constantly maintain a large workload while ignoring any potential negative impact that their heavy workload may have on their life. This can surface in their life in constant thoughts regarding work that still needs to be done while outside of a person's working hours. Although workaholism is not inherently related to spending an excessive amount of time working, it may include a person who has agreed to work more than what had been initially expected of them, either by themselves or their employer (Clark 2016).</p>

<h4>Why are these ideas important to consider in regards to tech?</h4>
<p>As technology becomes more ingrained in our everyday world, more jobs have made the move to heavily rely on devices and technology. This means that it is now easier than ever to work from a variety of places outside of the office due to the everyday use of tech through emails, online meetings, and online documents like word or google docs. The internet has allowed for faster communication between colleagues and online meeting apps such as Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams allows employees to attend meetings from outside of the workplace. With this, an employee has much more access to their work and "...technology and work may be mutually reinforcing addiction patternsâ€¦" says Clark (2016).</p>

<h4>What is addiction?</h4>
<p>Addiction is when someone consistently uses a substance or carries out a behaviour that they know is affecting their life in a negative way, yet they continue to do so. A person who is addicted to a substance or behaviour will seemingly be unable to go without their addiction and will have withdrawal symptoms if they try and go without the substance or behaviour that they are addicted to. This results in a person feeling like they cannot control how often they indulge themselves in their addiction, and instead go to great lengths to ensure that they can still use the substance or carry out the behaviour that they are addicted to. Common addictions are drug addictions such as nicotine, cocaine, marajuana and opioids (Tyler 2018). Other substance addictions include coffee, food, and technology. Examples of behavioural addictions include being addicted to work, sex, or gambling (Tyler 2018).</p>

<h4>Is technology addictive? Why?</h4>
<p>Technology such as computers, laptops, smartphones and tablets have features that make them addictive. There are multiple aspects of technology that lure people in. Social media creates a constant stream of new photos, videos, and updates that allows a person to spend hours scrolling without running out of things to look at. Social media is also easily accessible due to smartphones and other portable devices like tablets and smart watches, allowing a person to access social media at any hour of the day without having to log into their home or work computer. This accessibility is also present with video games, which is another aspect of technology that makes it addictive. Video games are purposefully designed to capture the attention of the player for as long as possible. There are also online communities surrounding video games such as subreddits and youtubers that the user can access on the very same device that they use to play the game (Ford 2017). This allows a person to not only find enjoyment in the game itself, but also a sense of belonging within a certain game's community which, as human beings, is something that everyone craves.</p>
