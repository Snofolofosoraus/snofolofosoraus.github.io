<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>
<p>
  Excessive usage of technology is becoming a risk to teens and young adults overall well being
  <br> and workaholism is becoming common in individuals, especially perfectionists, which for most of 
  <br> them leads to the disconnection from the reality, the inability to connect with their family and also 
  <br> the reason for childrens and therefore the future generation to become more technology reliant. <br>
</p>
<p><h2>How Does technology addiction affect a person's overall wellbeing and what is the cause for technology addiction?</h2></p>

<p>The reason why technology can become so addicting is because technology efficiently satisfies our innate human desire for entertainment, connection, and changes in the environment. When kids are stressed, whether it's due to a love rejection or a poor test score, technology may become a simple alternative to meet fundamental requirements, and as a result, it can become addicting. Technology affects the same way on the striatum (inside our reward system) in our brain as any use of substance would. Like alcohol or drugs, technology often gives the individual rewards like boredom buster or an escape from reality (Hazelden Betty Ford, 2017). Like alcoholics or drug addicts, technology has become a place to hide for most people from reality. Inability to accept things or connect with people pushes them towards the overuse of technology. Past traumas or present conflict can all lead to an individual burying themselves in the internet. People feel more safe to open up through screens than face to face. While depending on the type of involvement with technology, can have a good effect or a very bad effect. Individuals start to develop an unrealistic relational security while they indulge in communication with unseen strangers. They start to develop an unhealthy desire for instant gratification, thanks to how fast technology moves, and how fast we are able to obtain information. A slow internet or electric cut leads to irritation and aggressiveness. It's as if someone snacthed their oxygen tank (Hazelden Betty Ford, 2017). According to research, 1 in every 5 children aged between 13 and 18 will most likely become a victim of serious mental illness before adulthood. 11% of these children have  mood disorder, 10% of them have behavior or conduct disorders and 8% of them have anxiety disorder (Children's bureau 2019). A 2017 study on adults aged between 19-32 found out that people with excessive use of technology were 3 times more likely to feel isolated than those using it within limits. Excessive usage of technology can lead to people being less physically active which can lead to many other health problems like aggressive behavior, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and premature death (medical news today 2020). Tech has become an oxygen tank for individuals, you take it away for a second and you'll see them erupt like a volcano. They become desperate and can become aggressive and violent.</p>
<p>
  As many occupations now require people to work with technology more and therefore obsessively passionate and perfectionist individuals end up spending quite a lot of time on it. The line between work and home is blurred leading to excessive usage of the internet. This can lead to mental health conditions which can also have an impact on their physical and social life. Workaholism can do goods to business but it could also affect the overall performance. For example; decreased productivity, impaired judgment, emotional and nervous breakdowns, burnouts and poor health(University of Nevada, Reno). Long and long hours of sitting down working can also lead to a lack of involvement in physical activity which could lead to health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease. Your immune system may be gravely weakened by the prolonged stress of being a workaholic. Workaholism can also lead to a negative impact on their family life and other relationships, it'll start to fall apart as the people around them will feel neglected. Workaholics  can start to have a hard time relating to others feelings. An article by Steve Merritt expresses that workaholism has a deleterious impact on the brain. Irritability, despair, and anxiety are all symptoms of the seemingly constant strain. Workaholics are likely to experience insomnia due to their never ending planning of their next project or meetings in their mind. The article states that harm to the nervous system isn't just possible but guaranteed if they continue to work that way. Workaholism can also lead to poor nutrition as they'll often be consuming fast food and a lot of caffeine. Caffeine consumption can damage hearing and the brain, causing migraines and high blood pressure. Caffeine in excessive doses can also become addictive (Hedley Scott, 2018). Overall, excessive use of technology is not only harmful for us but this earth too, the land we live on, the air we breath, the water and the food we consume.
