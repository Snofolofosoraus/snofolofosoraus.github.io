<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

    <p><h1>Higher Working Hours are equal to Higher Pay?</h1></p>
    <p>
        There are many opportunities that companies and people can get out of this topic.<br /> M Baekar’s Computer and Society: Modern perspectives under chapter 12 focuses
        <br /> majority on the possible damage that this Tech addiction does to humans, in terms of<br />damaging the mental health and the physical body of a human. One of the possible
        <br />opportunity that Baeker mentions is “high-tech industries such as video games, where it<br /> is rou­tine for employees to work eighty or even 100 hours a week for several months
        <br />before a new product release.” To support Baeker’s statement I was able to scout out a<br />data gathered up by GDC which is the Game developers conference, the site offers a
        <br />annual report on the industry as a whole and in that it has multiple poll data, in it which<br />one of the pages speaks about the average hours in a single week that the workers
        <br />worked on a video game in the last 12 months, as the report was published in the first<br />half of 2021. The data shows that the highest trend was around the 30 to 40
        <br />hours per week mark, but the annual reports also writes how in some “extreme” cases<br />there were workers that went on to work 90 to 100+ hours a week, this goes to clearly
        <br />show that for game developers there is a possible opportunity out in the game industry<br />as they can turn their negative addiction to tech into useful help, yes there are definitely
        <br />side effects to it, but it’s better to make sure that knowledge isn’t being wasted and that<br />maybe instead of seeing technology addiction or workaholism as  a negative impact, it
        <br />can be changed to a positive impact, as experience of the person would grow<br />depending on the time they spent working in that field. In conclusion, I like to believe
        <br />that this is a possible valid opportunity presented towards workaholics to step up, that<br />high tech companies offer as in the long term the skills learnt in high tech companies
        <br />will become essential and high paying.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another research shows that technology addiction and workaholism attribute is much<br />needed in a person, as recent articles show that the economy of New Zealand is in
        <br />potential trouble, due to COVID hitting NZ in 2020 and till now the economy has<br />received critical damage, this comes from the official NZ stats website where the graph
        <br />shows the drop around March 2020 as that’s when the lockdowns began So how does <br />this offer opportunity? Well the country is in need of workers as of the moment, A
        <br />article on Stuff written by Sarah Catherall on 5th June 2022 mentions how “economists<br />and analysts fear is the start of a mass exodus of skilled and talented young Kiwis
        <br />offshore.”, this is based on high profile job workers leaving NZ to go to the UK. This <br />creates a perfect opportunity for workaholics and those with the lust of technology to
        <br />step up and claim their spot, it is highly likely that this in the long term can prove to be<br />an essential opportunity for NZ to bring in highly skilled and enthusiastic workers, yet
        <br />this opportunity goes to both employees and employers around the world as the NZ<br />economy wasn’t the only one damaged. Workers that are addicted to their work can
        <br />show their interest, as a possible outcome from this is not only experience growth, but<br />also growth with salary as employers will seek to gather the best and hard working ones
        <br />to boost their performances, that is also how technology addiction falls in. During the<br />current period where the economy is low but on the other hand the technology invention
        <br />and innovation is increasing, with more and more opportunities being present for <br />workers, knowledge or interest in technology can play a main factor as around the
        <br />world, in today's age majority of the jobs function on or through technology. This leads<br />me to conclude that an opportunity like this is in demand more than ever, also how the
        <br />research conducted supports this, even though my research is based on NZ economy,<br />we cannot ignore the other countries that are still facing COVID or going through an
        <br />economic crisis.
