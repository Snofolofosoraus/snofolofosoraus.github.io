    <p><h1>Apple's Initiation Towards The Cause.</h1></p>

    <p>
        The aspect of Technology addiction and Workaholism come with many negative<br />reflections, that point towards how both of these aspects are damaging the environment
        <br />and the people captured by it. Thanks to companies that have identified the issues with<br />tech addiction and workaholism, it has allowed us to look after our health and safety if
        <br />we make the correct choices. One of the big companies to take a step towards this is<br />Apple, they have given their customers choice to have the option to set screen time on
        <br />their devices, which controls the amount of time and shares data on the usage of the<br />device by the customer, as per an Article written in the Forbes, by Alice G. Walton, she
        <br />speaks on how Investors are pressuring Apple over the psychological risks of screen<br />time for kids. The article reflects on the mental health of the kids who spend “an
        <br />average of 4.4 hours a day”, for a young child this is a concern, for their well being, but<br />how has Apple responded over the years? This article was written in 2018 and since
        <br />than Apple have made multiple attempts over the years to address this issue by adding<br />a ‘Screen Time’ feature, this feature allows the device to gather the data of the user on
        <br />how much they spend time on apps, or on screen and upon that display a report, this<br />feature also allows parents to set up screen time for their kids. Apple still seek to make
        <br />this feature more compatible in regards to the health and safety of their users, multiple<br />articles reflect on the impact this app has made, according to an article on the Verge
        <br />written June 7 2022 by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, Jennifer reflects on how this feature is<br />useful, and that the features within it are easily controllable and easy to understand
        <br />compared to other companies that also provide this feature.

    <p><h1>The Choice In Our Hands!!!</h1></p>

    <p>
        Another article that speaks about the the digital age has impacted us can be seen as positive in<br />many ways, written by Sophie Aziakou in Dec 2017, Sophie studies into the research that
        <br />UNICEF has committed towards the cause of technology, though it may not specifically be<br />directed towards the aspect of technology addiction and workaholism, it still shows the choices
        <br />we are presented with as people living in the digital age, the content that Sophie writes on is<br />also aimed at much younger audience and it helps as the young audience are the one growing
        <br />in the digital age and learning vast majority of new skills and creating inventions and<br />innovations. What stands out most is that within the article Sophie uses quotes and experiences
        <br />from young teenagers and adults, and Sophie looks into children that come from different<br />backgrounds and how technology has presented them. As per 19 year old Garry:<br />

        <img src="../images/Choices-Img1.png" /><br /> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2017/12/11/growing-up-in-a-digital-age/?sh=671c9efcc189">This image is from Forbes article, written by Sophie Aziakou, quoting Gary.</a><br />

        <br />Another teenager, 16 year old Jenn from the United States says:<br />

        <img src="../images/Choices-Img2.png" /><br /><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2017/12/11/growing-up-in-a-digital-age/?sh=671c9efcc189">This image is from Forbes article, written by Sophie Aziakou, quoting Jenn.</a><br />

        <br /> Both statements reflect on the use of technology, and it is easy to accept their opinion as<br />reality as both what Jenn and Gary say is true, the fact that technology has given us the choice
        <br />to be powerful with it gives us the choice to use it for the greater good or not. Though the<br />choices presented from this is very arguable, as given the choice it depends on the user or the
        <br />person on how they utilize, also the fact that many see technology addiction as a major negative<br />factor, it still doesn't disregard the fact that we are very advanced in the modern world because
        <br />of technology, and that is why we have to learn and understand our responsibility when it<br />deciding on the safer and smarter choices when it comes around to the utilization of technology.
