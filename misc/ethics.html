  <h1><p>Ethical Reflections and Reccomendations</p></h1>

<p><b><u><h2>Shannon Winner Christian</h2></u></b></p>

<p>
    Reflecting on my research, I would like to conclude my opinion which leads me to say that<br />ethically the topic of Technology addiction and workaholism is not ethically correct in its own
    <br />ways, this is highly due to the risk factors that oppose the opportunities presented, through<br />research of my own I was able to see how the risk factors are critically damaging as they can
    <br />occur in short terms affecting mental health, where as the opportunities presented reward more<br />in long term after the risks have already occurred or will occur. I believe the choices presented
    <br />from this topic is more dependent on the ethics of the company and the person making them, as<br />the user has much more option to choose between the right and wrong choice whether they
    <br />know the outcomes of it are good or bad, whereas company like Apple is much more limited, as<br />they must follow the ethical standards to sell their product.
